# Reaktor Pre-assignment for my job application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
The work here is basically me learning about "advanced" API usage and mass JSON data handling for a week. Learned a lot but still alot to learn! :)  

##CURRENTLY WORKING ON "MERN" STACK TO MAKE THE PROJECT ALOT MORE OPTIMIZED

## To start


In project directory, run:

### `npm start`

## The project was build fully with create-react-app and its available modules.

It is not yet optimized and has a lot of work to do to make it handle the data and renders better.  
Couldn't figure out the CORS error when fetching data for the time being, so I used a chrome extension called **[Moesif Origin & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)** - TO BE RESOLVED  

# TODO:

- Better data handling to minimize the amount of 429 errors and the need of API calls in general
- Figure out the CORS situation
- UI design optimization
- Code commenting and fixing...
- Fixing onClick unresponsiveness
